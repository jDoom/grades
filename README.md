Grades android app

This app helps students track their grades on their smartphones. It's made for hungarian students, so you can have 5 types of grades: 1,2,3,4,5. Your final grade at the end of the year is the rounded average of theese.
In the app you can add subjects, and grades and it provides you some useful informations. It has a widget too which is not fully done yet, just like the app itself.
I'm planning to add a bunch of functions in the future.
